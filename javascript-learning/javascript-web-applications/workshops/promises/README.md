# Using `fetch` and Promises

## Learning goals
 * Send an HTTP request using `fetch`.
 * Execute code to change the page when the response is received.
 * Use `await` to make our code "wait" for the promise value.

## Setup

Make sure the repo is cloned to your machine first.

```bash
cd javascript-web-applications/workshops/promises/exercise
npm install
npm run build
```

## Intro - Making a request with `fetch`

```js
const something = fetch('https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people');

console.log(something); // what is this?
```

`fetch` sends an HTTP request to the given URL, and returns a `Promise` object. Even though we are not creating the `Promise` value ourselves, it is created by `fetch` under the hood ‚Äî and we use it to access the response when it becomes available.

<details>
  <summary>Show a working example</summary>

  ```js
  const promise = fetch('https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people');

  promise.then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
  });
  ```
</details>

## Modelling the process

[You can use network throttling in the browser developer console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#throttling) to simulate a slow network connection.

Having a basic mental model of the Promises process is important to use them correctly ‚Äî diagram the following steps in the correct order in which they happen:

 * The promise state moves to `fulfilled`.
 * The promise is initialised.
 * We call `fetch()`.
 * The promise state moves to `pending`.
 * The HTTP response is received.
 * The HTTP request is sent.
 * The callback function given to `.then()` is called.

## Exercise (30min)

[Here's an example of how to use `fetch` to get JSON data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

(don't forget to make sure `npm run build` is running somewhere).

1. Use `fetch` to make a request to `https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people`, and when the response is received:
      * Display the received data into the console.
      * Change the content of the page to add one new `<div>` element for each name in the JSON list (append them to the `#container` div).
      * You'll know it works if you reload the page and see the list of names being displayed on the page.

2. Instead of fetching (and showing) the list of people straight when the page loads, **make it happen when the user clicks on the button.**

Answer the following questions as you work through the exercise:
  * What kind of HTTP request does `fetch` send? (check in the developer console's Network tab)
  * What happens if the request fails? How we can we handle failures?

## Discussion

* What type of HTTP request does `fetch` send?
* How we can we handle failures?
* Why do we need to call `.then` twice?

<details>
  <summary>Show explanation</summary>

  ```js
  const firstPromise = fetch('https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people');

  // The first Promise returned by `fetch` is "fulfilled" when the response is available, however its JSON data is not "ready" yet.
  const secondPromise = firstPromise.then((response) => {
    
    // Because the JSON data in the response might be very large (we could stream a very long JSON document), we need to call `data.json()`, which returns another promise.
    return response.json();
  });

  // `secondPromise` is the promise returned by `response.json()` - it is fulfilled when the program has finished reading the JSON data. 
  secondPromise.then((jsonData) => {

    // The JSON data is now available as a JavaScript object, and we can use it.

    console.log(jsonData);

    jsonData.forEach(item => console.log(item));
  });


  // It's common to write all the above more concisely this way:
  fetch('https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((jsonData) => {
      // ...
    });

  ```
</details>

## Part 2 - Using `await`

```js
const promise = await fetch('https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people');

console.log(promise); // what is this?
```

Using `await` in front of `fetch` allows us to directly get the result ‚Äî however, this means our code now "waits" for `fetch` to receive the response.

## Exercise (20 min)

 * Update the exercise code to use `await` for the two promises, and remove the two calls to `.then()`
 * Check the terminal where `npm run build` is running ‚Äî it's likely you got the following error: 
 ```
  "await" can only be used inside an "async" function
 ```
 * Follow the error output suggestions to add the [`async` keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function#syntax), and reload the page.

## Discussion

 * What can you say about the behaviour of `await` and `async`?
 * How can you use `fetch` to save the state of your web application in a robust way? (and not on the user's machine)
 * How are promises different from callbacks?
